## TTS engines :id=tts-engines

The Microsoft Edge TTS engine and the OpenAI TTS engine are now ready. Go ahead and give them a try!
(You can quickly switch by toggling the engine action or clicking on the translation icon in the status bar.)

### Microsoft Edge TTS Engine (Experimental) :id=microsoft-edge-tts-engine

<br/>

![Microsoft Edge TTS Engine](/en/updates/img/v3_6/microsoft_edge_tts_logo.svg ':size=x60')

!> The Microsoft Edge TTS Engine is an experimental feature that may be discontinued or
modified at any time in the future.

The Microsoft Edge TTS Engine is based on Azure AI's text-to-speech service, supporting multiple languages and voices.
It uses advanced deep neural network technology to convert text into natural-sounding speech with fluent pronunciation.

The plugin has set Microsoft Edge TTS as the default text-to-speech engine.
You can directly use it to read aloud the text you want. Microsoft Edge TTS supports multiple languages and voices,
and it automatically selects a suitable voice based on the language of the target text when reading.
Of course, you can also manually select your preferred voice in the settings dialog,
and you can also configure the speech rate.

### OpenAI TTS Engine :id=openai-tts-engine

<br/>

![OpenAI TTS Engine](/img/openai_logo.svg ':size=x60')

The OpenAI TTS engine is based on OpenAI's text-to-speech model, which converts text into natural-sounding speech.
It currently offers two models: `tts-1` (optimized for speed) and `tts-1-hd` (optimized for quality),
and comes with six different built-in voices (`alloy`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, and `shimmer`).

The OpenAI TTS engine operates through the OpenAI API, so before using it, you'll need to configure it accordingly:

?> Tip: Basic configurations such as authentication are shared with the OpenAI Translator engine.

!> Please remember, your `API key` is private! Do not share or disclose your API key with anyone else.

## Translation :id=translation

### Dictionary and example sentences :id=dictionary-and-example-sentences

Now, the Microsoft translation engine includes dictionary definitions
and example sentences in the translation results for individual words.
You can view dictionary definitions and usage examples in the translation results:

## Translation engine :id=translation-engine

### OpenAI Translator engine :id=openai-translator-engine

#### Azure OpenAI support :id=azure-openai-support

The OpenAI Translator engine now supports Azure OpenAI as a service provider.
Select `Azure` from the service provider dropdown options in the translation engine settings dialog
and configure the required model deployment name, API key,
and API endpoint to access the translation service provided by Azure OpenAI:

![Azure OpenAI support](/en/updates/img/v3_6/azure_openai.png)

Configuration Item Descriptions:

- The model deployment name refers to the name chosen when deploying the model.
You need to create and deploy the relevant Azure OpenAI service resources in the Azure portal to get this name.
Learn how to [create and deploy Azure OpenAI service resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).
- The API key and API endpoint are the necessary credentials and service address to access the Azure OpenAI API.
Go to the resource page in the Azure Portal, and in the resource management section,
you can find the `API endpoint` and `API key`.
Learn how to [get the API endpoint and API key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?pivots=rest-api).

?> Tip: The service provider, Azure OpenAI API key, and Azure OpenAI API endpoint configuration items are shared
between the OpenAI Translator engine and the OpenAI TTS engine.

#### Custom API endpoint :id=customize-openai-api-endpoint

A new `API endpoint` configuration item has been added to the OpenAI settings,
allowing you to choose from more third-party OpenAI service providers.

![Custom API endpoint](/en/updates/img/v3_6/openai_endpoint.png)

?> Tip: The `API endpoint` configuration item is optional. If you're unsure how to configure it, you can keep
the default value. This configuration item is shared between the OpenAI Translator engine and the OpenAI TTS engine.
Additionally, since the OpenAI Translator engine and OpenAI TTS engine use specific API interfaces,
customizing the path portion of the API endpoint is not supported.

#### OpenAI models :id=openai-models

The list of models supported by the OpenAI translation engine has been updated to include the latest models such as
`GPT-4-Turbo`, `GPT-4o`, etc. You can select the model you want to use in the translation engine settings dialog.
