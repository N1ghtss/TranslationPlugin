### Translation Prompt Template :id=translation-prompt-template

We have added the ability to customize translation prompt templates for the OpenAI translation engine. You can now create your own translation prompt templates to better suit your translation needs. Currently, this feature is only supported through configuration files. You can create the corresponding prompt template files in the specified directory and use the [Apache Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html) template language to write your translation prompt templates. For more details, please refer to the tutorial: [How to Customize OpenAI Translation Prompts](/tutorial/how_to_customize_translation_prompts.md).

### AI Model :id=ai-model

The OpenAI translation engine now supports freely selecting different AI models. You can input any model name, no longer limited to the default model:

### API Endpoint :id=api-endpoint

The API endpoint for the OpenAI translation engine is now fully customizable. By customizing the API endpoint and AI model, you can use more third-party AI services compatible with the OpenAI Chat API, such as:

- [DeepSeek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/zh-cn/)
- [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai?hl=zh-cn#rest)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
- [Kimi](https://platform.moonshot.cn/docs/guide/migrating-from-openai-to-kimi)
- ...

?> Tip: The API endpoint configuration is divided into two parts. The first part is the base URL excluding the path, and the second part is the path. For example, `https://api.deepseek.com` is the base URL, and `/v1/chat/completions` is the path. The base URL in the first part can be shared with the OpenAI TTS engine. For third-party AI service configuration, please refer to the tutorial: [Configuring Third-Party AI in OpenAI Translator](/en/tutorial/configuring_3party_ai_in_openai_translator.md).

## OpenAI TTS Engine :id=openai-tts-engine

### TTS API Configuration :id=tts-api-config

The API configuration for the OpenAI TTS engine is now independent of the OpenAI translation engine, with separate API endpoints and key configurations. Of course, you can choose to share the configuration with the OpenAI translation engine:
