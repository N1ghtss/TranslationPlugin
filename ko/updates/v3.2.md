We've added a new translation engine â€“ the **Alibaba Translation Engine**.The **Alibaba Translation Engine** is an intelligent machine translation service created by Alibaba. Relying on its leading natural language processing technology and the advantages of its massive online database, it provides multi-language, multi-scenario, and multi-modal language solutions.

The **Alibaba Translation Engine** provides a free quota of one million characters per month to meet your needs.It offers a wide selection of languages and supports basic text translation as well as user-friendly document translation:

?> Using the **Alibaba Translation Engine** requires registering for an Alibaba Cloud account and accessing the [Universal Translation Engine](https://www.aliyun.com/product/ai/base_alimt). Then, [visit the credential management page](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/manage/ak) to get the **AccessKey ID** (**Application ID**) and the **AccessKey Secret** (**Application Key**). Tip: Please keep your **AccessKey ID** and **AccessKey Secret** safe to prevent security breaches and loss of personal property.
