### OpenAI Translator Engine (Experimental) :id=openai-translator-engine

<br/>

![OpenAI Translator Engine](/img/logo/openai.svg ':size=x60')

!> OpenAI Translator engine is an Experimental feature. It may be dropped or changed at any time.

The OpenAI Translator engine is a translation engine based on the OpenAI API.
It leverages advanced deep learning models through the OpenAI API to provide powerful translation capabilities,
delivering accurate and fluent translation results while ensuring translation quality and accuracy.

The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication.
Before using it, you need to configure your **API key** in the OpenAI settings dialog.

!> **Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it.

?> Tip: Since document translation consumes more tokens,
we recommend that you set `Automatic Document Translation` to `Off` when using the OpenAI Translator engine.

### Google Translate Engine :id=google-translate-engine

#### Custom translation server :id=google-server-config

Now you can customize the Google translation server or mirror server you want to use,

#### Domain-specific Translation support :id=youdao-translation-domain

### Translate and Replace operation improvements :id=translate-and-replace

The "Translate and Replace" operation has been optimized and improved for multi-line text.
When performing translate and replacement on a multi-line text,
the translation results are no longer merged into a single line.
Instead, the original line breaks are preserved, ensuring the readability of the translated results.
Additionally, line breaks will be explicitly displayed in the result preview list,
allowing you to better preview the translation results.
